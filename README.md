😄 My name is João Vitor Gino

🎓 I'm graduated in Analysis and Systems Development

💻 I developed some systems and services to big companies with any technologies, like Laravel, Node.js, Go, ASP.NET and Flutter.

😍 I've always been an enthusiast for everything that involves technology

🌌 I am passionate about the search for knowledge!

🌎 My goal is visit the world

✈️ Traveling and getting to know new cultures are my favorite hobbies

🖱️ Here you will find some of my projects! ✨ Enjoy ✨

I have some projects to show my knowledge about programming languages, architectural designs, clean code, devops world and some other topics.

I created a roadmap from basic to advanced, the basic's projects are the applications that I didn't give so much effort and time and the advanced projects are the applications that I needed to give more attention.

My purpose is to develop all the projects, but there are some projects that I didn't realize yet. Every week I work in one of each.

Each project has a few things I need to do, besides developing, I need to draw an acceptable architecture, write the documentation, test and post it here.
